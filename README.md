### 💫 About Me
I'm an INFP developer who believes coding is poetry and applications are stories waiting to be told. I dance between logic and creativity, building digital experiences with a touch of magic—like turning `console.log()` into heartfelt confessions and algorithms into love stories.

I see programming languages as different ways to express the same human needs, much like Taylor's eras represent different phases of storytelling. Whether it's the folkloric simplicity of vanilla JS or the synth-pop complexity of distributed systems, every project has its own melody.

### 🌌 INFP Developer Mantra
*Coding between what is and what could be, building bridges between logic and dreams. I'm not just writing code—I'm composing digital poetry in a world that often prefers prose.*
